#MERN TO-DO APP

**About the Application**
This is a full-stack To-Do List web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with features like login/signup, task prioritization, and status tracking.

**User Authentication**
The app starts with a login/signup page.

Users can create an account or log in securely to manage their personal task list.

Once authenticated, users are redirected to their task dashboard.

**Task Management Dashboard**
Users can add tasks using the input bar.

Each task can be assigned a priority level: Low, Medium, or High.

Tasks are displayed with their status (pending or complete) and priority.

You can mark tasks as complete, edit priorities, or delete them anytime.

 **Filtering Options**
Two dropdown filters allow users to sort tasks by:

Status (All, Pending, Completed)

Priority (All, Low, Medium, High)

This helps users focus on urgent or important tasks more effectively.

**UI & UX**
Clean and minimal design using soft tones for a user-friendly experience.

The responsive layout ensures smooth usage on both desktops and mobile devices.

Buttons and forms are intuitive and easy to interact with.
